I wanted a thicc font but couldn't find any for 12x12 px so...


I took some """artistic liberties""" with some of these chars...
- the root/radical sign is now a checkmark
- some signs like the integral and function signs, and the asterisk (*) are deliberately ambiguous to allow for multiple uses
- if the ampersand (&) looks weird that's because I write them weird. Treat it as a tree or flower or something... :^)
- some letters like X have cutoffs perpendicular to the stroke rather than aligned to the pixel grid, because... aesthetics


feel free to copy this and use it yourself, although I'd prefer credit :^)
